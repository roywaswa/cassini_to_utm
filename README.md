# Cassini to UTM Converter (Python)

Welcome to the Cassini to UTM Converter project! This Python script aims to provide a simple and efficient way to convert Cassini coordinates used in Kenya to UTM (Universal Transverse Mercator) coordinates.

## Introduction

In Kenya, the Cassini coordinate system is commonly used for mapping purposes. However, when working with GIS (Geographic Information System) applications or other mapping tools that utilize UTM coordinates, it becomes necessary to convert between the two systems. This script automates the conversion process, enabling users to easily obtain UTM coordinates from Cassini coordinates.

## Features

- **Cassini to UTM Conversion:** The script accepts Cassini coordinates as input and converts them to UTM coordinates using established conversion algorithms.
- **Accuracy and Precision:** The conversion algorithms employed in the script ensure accuracy and precision in the resulting UTM coordinates.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** The script provides a simple and intuitive command-line interface for inputting Cassini coordinates and obtaining the corresponding UTM coordinates.
- **Library Usage:** The script is designed as a standalone tool, but the underlying conversion functions can also be used as a library within other Python projects.
